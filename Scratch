Hereâ€™s my proposed schedule from December 2025 to January 2026. I will be travelling to USA from December 6 (Saturday) night until January 14 (Wednesday).
Critical days will be on December 28 and 29 as we are both OFF. I will try to get online those days but still depends on what will be my situation there. Let me know if this will work for you or if you have any suggestion.
